# Virtual-Air-Paint-Brush
Technology Used: Python, Computer Vision, Detection Steps.  
This project is Based on the Virtual Writing on the Screen without any hurdle, so that one can easily explain the things in a very quick way which also looks very unique and stylish way.  
First we set the Video Capture that opens up your system camara.  
Then, in order to write down anything on the screen, simply show  first 2 fingers and draw.  
If you want to move from one part to another then show only 1st finger on the screen.  
Then applied some of the techniques like thresolding, bitwise_and images, bitwise_or images etc.  
We have already decided which gesture doing what earlier.  
In addition to that, we have created one track bar to change the color of the pen/brush. which is the unique thing that we have included in our project.
